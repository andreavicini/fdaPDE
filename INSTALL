#INSTALL

There are many ways to install this package, but
not all of them work for Windows users. Here we suggest two that do the job:

1.  Download the .zip folder from GitHub and unzip it on your local PC; then, on the R console, type:
  install.packages("/path/to/fdaPDE/folder", type="source", repos=NULL)
2.  From the terminal, run:
  R CMD build <path to folder fdaPDE>
  R CMD INSTALL -l <path name of the R library tree>
  <path name of the package to be installed>

In R, using the popular R package devtools, you can install the fdaPDE package and all of its dependencies using the
command
install_github("andreavicini/fdaPDE")

Alternatively in unix systems it can be installed by manually creating the compressed package with:
  tar -czf /path/to/new/compressed/package.tar.gz /path/to/fdaPDE/folder
and then install it with
  install.packages("/path/to/new/compressed/package.tar.gz")
